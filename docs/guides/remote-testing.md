# Remote Testing

**Remote Testing** using the Weylon application allows for increased visibility into customer issues. The process consists of three steps.

!!! note "Testing Results"
    Reports for the data visualization of test results are presently in development.

## Provision Test

First, provision the desired test in the ConnexCS Control Panel. Go to **Global :material-menu-right: Weylon**. This lists any existing tests.

**Create Test Configuration**

Click **:material-plus:** to create a new testing configuration.

+ **Name**: Name the new test, ideally something descriptive so you know what it will test.
+ **ID**: Its randomly generated by the system.
+ **Show Output**: When **Enabled**, it displays real-time results while the tests are running on the customer's equipment. When **Disabled**, it displays a progress bar, so there is no confusion about what all the results mean while the test is still running.

**Add Criteria**

Next to **Criteria**, click **:material-plus:** to specify the test parameters.

+ **Type**: Select to run Ping, Simulate Media, or Trace Route.
+ **Host**: Specify the Internet Protocol (IP) or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
+ **Level**: Select any one of the 3 options to vary the intensity of the test:
    + **Basic:** Single, quick test.
    + **Standard:** Captures a moderate amount of data without much detail.
    + **Advanced:** Detailed soak test, which can last several minutes.

**Save work**

+ Click **`Save`** for the Criteria. Add additional test Criteria as required.
+ Click **`Save`** to complete the test setup.

## Customer Setup

Next, the customer needs to install Weylon on their Linux machine.

**Install the Application**

```bash
wget https://app.connexcs.com/files/weylon

chmod +x ./weylon
```

**Execute the Test**

```bash
./weylon -i ABCD
```

## View Results

All test results report back to your Control Panel under **Global :material-menu-right: Weylon**.
