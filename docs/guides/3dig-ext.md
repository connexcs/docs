# 3-Digit Extension Dialling

You can set up 3-digit dialling in several ways. This is a basic setup for quick deployment.

1. Set up an [**Internal Number Block**](/customer/main/#internal-number-block) for the customer.

2. Set up an [**Alias**](/customer/alias/) for each extension.

3. Document internal extensions in the [**Phonebook**](/class5/phonebook/) (this step isn't so much functional as a reference).
