# Governing Bodies

Every country has a designated authority that governs all types of telecom and communication providers. As a VoIP service provider, you're required to know about the governing bodies, and the rules and regulations you need to comply with.

Internationally, the majority of telecom rules and regulations are standardized. However, each country and its telecom regulatory authority have their own set of unique rules and regulations that you need to be aware of.

If you’re operating within a single country, compliance is more streamlined. In case you operate internationally, you will be subjected to compliance in all the respective regions where you operate from.

With that said, let's take a look at the major telecom regulatory authorities around the world.
