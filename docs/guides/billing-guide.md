## Call Detail Records

**Call Detail Records (CDRs)** are historical records of all calls in a given period. These are billable and are the suggested data set for referring to questions about billing and invoices.

See the [**Customer CDR**](/customer/cdr) for more details.

## Invoices

Use ConnexCS **Invoices** for basic invoicing functions.

See [**Customer :material-menu-right: Invoice**](/customer/invoices) for more details.

## Payments

Use **Payments** to view and approve payments made on customer accounts. See [**Customer  :material-menu-right:Payment**](/customer/payment) for more details.

## Vouchers

**Vouchers** function like calling cards, and you can also apply for credits.
