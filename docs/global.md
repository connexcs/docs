# Global

The **Global** section of the ConnexCS Control Panel provides an account-wide overview of many of the same sections found in **Management :material-menu-right: Customer** or **Carrier**.

This can be helpful for troubleshooting issues across customers or in situations where you are trying to locate the customer of a specific Direct Inward Dial (DID).

You can also configure and manage some sections from the Global view.
