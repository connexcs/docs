### Creating a Record

Click :material-plus: under **CLI**.

_Field details:_

+ **Company**: Select the comapny from the drop-down.

+ **CLI**: To allow the required CLIs, enter the required number or a regular expression (to match and replace).

+ **Rewrite CLI**: A CLI can be rewritten. For example, you can add `123456789` in the CLI box and then rewrite by adding `987654321` in the rewrite CLI box. (For more advanced CLI manipulation, see [**Advanced CLI Match & Manipulation**](https://docs.connexcs.com/customer/cli/#advanced-cli-match-and-manipulation) below.)

+ The **P-Asserted-ID** manipulation uses the same syntax as the Replace CLI.

    !!! tip "P-Asserted-ID Use Case"
        If you wanted to allow all calls but assign a specific number (such as the Main Billable number for the business), you would set CLI as ".*" and then enter the desired P-Asserted ID.
        All calls will then have this number as the P-Asserted-ID.

+ **Rewrite P-Asserted-ID**: This is a SIP Header almost same as the FROM header but classified as a private, or network-level identifier.
Telephone companies use it to identify call originators. As it's stripped at the call server, the client end-points only see the FROM field.
This is helpful when callers obscure their CLI / FROM information, as the network level still requires origination details.

+ **Forced**: Enabling this will allow a call if there are no other matching CLIs in the system. This will also replace the CLI that's presented with the CLI entered here.

    !!! Example
        Create a permitted list of CLIs, then select **Forced** on the CLI to use if none of the others in the permitted list match. (Best practice is to have one unique **Forced** CLI.)

+ **Direction Applied**:
    + **Outbound Calls (Termination)**: Customer dials a number; CLI rules control which caller IDs are allowed to pass.
    + **Inbound Calls (Origination)**: Calls coming into the system (DID/DDI) can be filtered based on CLI rules.

    !!! Example
        1. Create a permitted list that exclusively allows calls to or from the same country.
        2. Only allow incoming calls with a CLI starting with 44 (UK numbers).

+ **Allow Type**: You can select from various options like Mobile, Paging, VoIP, Satellite etc to allow the CLIs.

+ **Use DID**: Pull in DIDs from the customer's account to use either as a Filter or as a Replacement.  

    !!! Example
        If Dialled matched number is starting with **1**, the CLI routes to 11111.
     The CLI can be a Regular Expression also.

    !!! Note "If you choose Disabled/Filer"
        1. **Hit Limit**: Usage Limit of this CLI.
        2. **Hit Interval**: Duration for which the hit limit remains active.

    !!! Note "If you choose Performance"
        1. **Performance Top Batch Size** choose how many of the top CLIs we use together.
        2. **Performance Interval**: Choose from the dropdown how long this batch stays active(in seconds). You can choose from the minimum value of 5 minutes and maximum value of 1 day with intervals of 300 seconds.
        3. **Performance Ban Time**: How long a used DID is paused for. You can choose the value from the dropdown with minimum value being 5 minutes and maximum value being 90 days. The value is stored in **seconds**.

+ **Database** (To add CLI and PAID from a database):

    1. Upload a list of numbers you choose as CLI or PAID under **Developer > Database**.
    2. Go to **Customer > Routing > CLI** add the same database under database field. Under rewrite PAID field add this database.

    !!! note
        Make sure you select  the **Forced** option as **Yes**.

+ **Dialed Number Match**: To route to a specific CLI, you dialled match number.

    !!! Note "CLI per Route"
        If a `Tech Prefix` is specified in Routing (Ingress Routing :material-menu-right: Basic :material-menu-right: Tech Prefix) and the same `Tech Prefix` is added to the `Dialed Number Match` (using ^), the corresponding CLI rule will be applied to that specific route.

+ **Notes**: Notes give you information about the CLI.

+ **STIR / SHAKEN Certificate:** If you apply any STIR / SHAKEN Certificate to a customer's account for calls verification, for example, whether the calls are spam.

    + **STIR / SHAKEN Attestation:** This is the level of a certification you can select from 3 levels `A`, `B`, or `C`.

+ **Flags**:
    + *Performance CLI Selection*: When you select **Forced** as **Yes** and select a **Database**, you get an option to select a flag which is Performance CLI Selection. The Performance CLI Selection chooses the CLI with the best ASR
    + *Stir Shaken Required*: Choose this option when no certificate is selected.
    + *Stir Shaken Replace*: Choose this option when you wish to apply your Stir-shaken certificate instead of which is  already applied (for a call).
