## Breakout

The Breakout Report gives a detailed view of customer profitability and call metrics.

The **Breakout** report lists account customers with associated profits, and relevant data such as how much each customer costs, and the cost, the Answer-Seisure Ratio (ASR), and the Average Call Duration (ACD), etc.

The information here is from a processed CDR and considered as "billing accurate," meaning the billing for the customers uses this data.

+ Use the fields at the top of the page to filter by Customers and Providers, and by date range. Each individual column can also filter the grid directly.
+ Use the Columns and Filters to manage data presentation.
+ Enable Pivot Mode (check box at the top of Columns) to setup Row Groups and Values for additional report customization.

!!! Example
    Drag Provider and Provider Destination to Row Groups to see which routes a provider is using for your calls.
