## Breakout

The **Breakout** report lists account customers with associated profits, and relevant data such as how much each customer costs, and the cost, the Answer-Seisure Ratio (ASR), and the Average Call Duration (ACD), etc.

The information here is from a processed CDR and considered as "billing accurate," meaning the billing for the customers uses this data.

+ Use the Columns and Filters to manage data presentation.
+ Enable Pivot Mode (check box at the top of Columns) to setup Row Groups and Values for additional report customization.

**Example**: Drag Provider and Provider Destination to Row Groups to see which routes a provider is using for your calls.
