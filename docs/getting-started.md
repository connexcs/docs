### Email Verification

Email verification is the process by which ConnexCS determines if an email address is genuine.
It's a measure against unauthorized users accessing customer accounts. It works similarly to most email verification mechanisms.
The system sends a verification code to the user's email, which is verified when the user enters the code back into the verification.

To verify your email address:

1. Select `Verify Email`. The Personal Profile Screen pops up.
2. Click the orange `!` next to Email, this generates a code and sends it to the email address.
3. Click the link in the email or copy & paste the code into the Verification Code field in the Verify Email pop-up
4. Click `Verify`.

### Mobile Verification

**Mobile Verification** is the process by which we verify mobile phone numbers to ensure that they're genuine, and is an extension of **Email Verification**.

Mobile Verification ensures all mobile devices associated with your account are genuine. Before verifying a mobile number, make sure the information is correct.

!!! note "Number Format"
    The number must be in E.164 format. E.164 numbers are formatted [+] [country code] [subscriber number including area code] and have a maximum of fifteen digits.

To verify a mobile number:

1. Select `Verify Mobile`. The Personal Profile Screen pops-up.
2. Make sure the number is correct and in E.164 format: [+] [country code] [subscriber number including area code] with maximum of fifteen digits.
