# Difference

Using two synchronised systems isn't always trivial, even if they're designed for that purpose. Slight variations between stats and Call Detail Records (CDRs) is normal and hence, most telecoms allow margins to compensate the error.

## Channels

You can use many variables to calculate channels and latency when reporting figures from one side to the other. Most user interfaces that report on channels also calculate for the inherent latency that occurs as data moves from the system to the UI.

- A ConnexCS Channel represents a bi-directional (2) audio stream.
- A channel represents any dialog state post routing-engine, including pre-ring, ringing, connected, and teardown.
  - There may be additional latency effects between servers.
