# ConnexCS Reference Data Sets

ConnexCS Data Sets are curated collections of external or internal regulatory, routing, fraud-prevention, and compliance-related information that enhance call processing, verification, and decision-making.

These Data Sets allow the platform to validate phone numbers, check compliance restrictions, identify high‑risk traffic, assess IP reputation, and support intelligent routing — all in real time.

They help customers improve call accuracy, reduce fraud, ensure legal compliance (such as DNC/TCPA rules), and optimize operational efficiency.

This page provides a consolidated overview of all databases available within ConnexCS, including whether they are free (included in the base subscription) or require an additional fee.
