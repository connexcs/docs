ConnexCS User Documentation
========================

Welcome to the **Connex Carrier Services User Documentation**. If you are new to ConnexCS, we recommend starting with the **[Getting Started Guides](https://docs.connexcs.com/getting-started/)**.

Also, take a quick look at the [**Dashboard overview**](https://docs.connexcs.com/dashboard/). It provides details on the ConnexCS home screen.  

See the [**Video Guide**](https://docs.connexcs.com/video-guide/) for more information. It also provides information on the standard functions of the system.

The remaining documentation covers all aspects of setup, configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

It acts as reference material besides being a repository for troubleshooting help.

It helps customers ask the right questions if a problem requires a call or a support ticket.

With newer versions and updates, we will continue to update the corresponding documentation.

You can submit a documentation request if you feel that a subject needs more attention.
