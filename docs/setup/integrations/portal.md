# Portal

**Setup :material-menu-right: Integrations :material-menu-right: Portal**

The **Portal** lets you add domains and sub-domains to the Control Panel, which the customer can access through the **Customer Portal**.

You can provide several domains for your customers through different brands, and each domain can have different permissions, currencies, default, etc.

## Portal Setup

**Step 1: Set up the CNAME record**

1. Access your domain account at your domain host.

2. Locate the page for updating your domain's DNS (Domain Name System) records.

    You can refer the page to as DNS Management, Name Server Management, or Advanced Settings.
3. Locate the `CNAME` records for your domain.

4. Add a new domain record (such as `portal.yourdomain.com`, where `yourdomain.com` is the domain that you own).

5. Point it toward `portal.connexcs.com.`

6. If asked, we recommend setting `TTL` at 300 (seconds), which is 5 minutes.

7. You can add the domain to ConnexCS as soon as you configure it.

!!! note "Your should expose your Customer Portal via a `CNAME` which you set up. This won't work with `A` records or pointing directly."

**Step 2: Add a Domain to Portal**

1. In **Portal**, click :material-plus:.
2. Enter the details in their respective fields of the ensuing window.
3. Click the **`Save`** button. Soon after, a certificate gets issued for the domain.

!!! note
    You should expose your Customer Portal via a `CNAME` that you setup. This won't work with `A` records or by pointing directly.
