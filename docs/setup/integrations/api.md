## Compare PayPal Options

**Mass Payment** is a bulk payment method that sends funds in an uploaded file to PayPal, allowing the sender to pay less than the standard PayPal fees using their bulk order discounts.

Since this payment doesn't trigger anything in our VoIP system, we link into PayPal's IPN to accommodate notifications and balance sheet updates.

**Mass Pay vs Express Checkout**

Use this comparison chart to decide between Mass Pay and Express Checkout with PayPal.

|Mass Pay|Express Checkout|
|---|---|
|PayPal's website receives an upload of a CSV (Comma-Separated Values)|Made through customer portal|
|Slightly lower transaction fees|Standard PayPal fees (about 3.4% + $0.30)|
|Sender pays the fee|Recipient pays the fee|
|Sender pays a 2% transaction fee, capped at $1 per payment|Recipient pays by per-transaction deductions|
|Uses PayPal IPN|Uses PayPal API Signature|

Payments made using this integration will automatically top up the customer's account in ConnexCS.
