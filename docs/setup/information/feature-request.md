## Introduction

A **Feature Request** is a suggestion made by a user or stakeholder for a new functionality or an enhancement to an existing system or software product.

Feature requests can come from internal teams, customers, or third-party partners, and they serve as a critical source of information for future product development.

In our system, feature requests are categorized and managed to ensure that the most relevant, valuable, and feasible features are prioritized.
