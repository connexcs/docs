The [**STIR / SHAKEN Cert**](https://docs.connexcs.com/setup/information/stir-shaken/#add-stirshaken-cert) is a necessary prerequisite step for call origination providers to adopt to authenticate telephone calls in the future.

The adoption of this standard helps to mitigate spoofing, robocalling, scam calls, etc.

For more detailed information, see our article, [**FCC Regulations Regarding Robocalling (TRACED Act)**](/guides/stir-shaken-fcc).

ConnexCS doesn't provide the STIR / SHAKEN Certificate.

You must get it from a designated authority, such as Ofcom or the FCC (for the FCC, this began June 30, 2021).

Once you have the certificate, it's added to ConnexCS as described in the steps below.
