## Add Certificate

To add a certificate:

1. Click on the :fontawesome-plus: symbol.
2. See the configuration details below to use either **Let's Encrypt** or a **User Provided** certificate.

### Let's Encrypt

1. Enter the **Domain** name for this certificate. To allow ConnexCS to manage your certificates, you must ensure that the DNS records are appropriately set to point to our server.
2. Set **User Provided** to "No."
3. Click **`Save`**Â and the system will provide you with the certificate.

**Let's Encrypt** renewals get  managed automatically.

### User Provided

1. Enter the domain name for this certificate.
2. Ensure that you have set **User Provided** to "Yes."
3. Certificate and keys should be in PEM (base64 format).
4. Enter your **Certificate** with the BEGIN and END tags as follows:

    ```bash
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

    <enter certificate here>

    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

5. Enter your Private **Key** with the BEGIN and END tags as follows:

    ```bash
    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

    <enter certificate here>

    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    ```

6. Enter your **CA(Certificate Authority) Certificate** with the BEGIN and END tags as follows:

    ```bash
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

    <enter certificate here>

    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

Renewals for **User Provided** certificates are your responsibility.
