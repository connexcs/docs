# SIP Profile

**Setup :material-menu-right: Config :material-menu-right: SIP Profile**

## Introduction

In simple terms, you can think of SIP Profile as a way to group a lot of users together. These users will have common features and services to use when they log in with the SIP Profile.

For example, there is a call center with 100 agents and an operator too. The operator might need some extra features than the agents. The feature might include listening to the calls or dialling certain numbers with the agents who aren't allowed to. Thus, the operator might want to have a different SIP Profile.

When someone logs into the [Web Phone](https://docs.connexcs.com/webphone/), they log in through their **SIP Profile**. They log in with the **SIP User Authentication**.

## Steps to setup the SIP Profile
