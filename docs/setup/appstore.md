    See this icon? ![owner](image-1.png). It means you built this application and the ownership belongs to you.

## How to Display documentation for your Application

1. You can add information about your specific application by using the **Template** component in the **IDE** section.
2. [Click here](https://docs.connexcs.com/apps/architecture/template/#how-to-add-a-template) to follow the instructions on how to create a template and add documentation, however, note that **template name** should actually be **app_documentation**.
