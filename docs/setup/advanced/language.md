## Overview

The system offers robust language customization features that allow you to tailor language settings to your organization’s interface needs.

You can add non-English equivalents for words in your preferred language or revise system defaults.

!!! info "Multiple entries for one Key"
    If you add a non-English equivalent for a word, say 'Channel' as 'canal', but there is an existing entry for 'Channel' as 'Canales', the Control Panel replaces the default entry with your new word.

### Key Features

+ **Custom Translations**:
    + Add or modify translations for any language.
    + **For example**, update the Russian translation for “support chat” if the default is incorrect.

+ **Multi-Language Compatibility**: Changes made are automatically reflected when switching languages.

+ **Reset to Default**: A reset option is available to revert custom translations back to the default settings.

+ **Dynamic Updates**: When a different language is selected, the system applies your custom translations immediately.

### Benefits

+ **Enhanced Localization**: Provides more accurate and culturally appropriate language support.
+ **Flexibility and Control**: Easily update and manage translations as needed.
+ **User-Friendly Experience**:  Automatic updates and reset functionality simplify language management.
