Use the **Language** interface to customize your selected interface language.

You can add non-English equivalents for words in your preferred language or revise system defaults.

    If you add a non-English equivalent for a word, say 'Channel' as 'canal', but there is an existing entry for 'Channel' as 'Canales', the Control Panel replaces the default entry with your new word.

## Add Non-English Equivalents

If you have changed the default language (see [**User Interface Display Language**](https://docs.connexcs.com/changing-language/) for details) but see missing terms, you can add them in the Language panel.

1. In the `Language` sub-menu on the left, select the language you want to use.
2. (Optional) Search for the specific word before adding.
3. Click :material-plus: to create a new entry.
    * **Key:** English word in the system.
    * **Translation:** non-English equivalent.
4. Click `Save`.
5. If the new translation isn't displayed, click `Refresh`, located at the top of the page.
