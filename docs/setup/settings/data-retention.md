The **Data Retention** page displays presently stored data in the archive on a monthly basis.

Data is periodically archived here from the live servers. You may query both live and archive data from the Call Detail Record (CDR) section.

Thus, your query may not span between live and archived data.

You can download the data from this page.

    As a Managed Service Provider for telecommunications, there are several laws governing data retention. 
    
    The ConnexCS platform is neutral in this matter. 
    
    It's the customer's responsibility to abide by all the laws of your country and jurisdiction with regards to retaining or purging data.
