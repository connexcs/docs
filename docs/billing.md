## ConnexCS Billing Per Channel

Billing per-channel is the traditional approach, where the consumer pays for a set number of channels or ports. It's like the VoIP equivalent of per-line billing in mobile networks.

### Advantages of Billing Per Channel

+ Cheaper than per-minute billing in systems with consistent traffic and high usage.
+ Free servers are available for several tiers of service.
+ Predictable costs allow for more stable billing cycles and simplified cost-benefit analysis.

### Disadvantages of Billing Per Channel

+ Inconsistent traffic often leads to higher costs.
+ Capacity planning is inherently less flexible.

## ConnexCS Billing per minute

In per-minute billing, the number of seconds you use gets tallied daily. Its combined with the per-minute cost, and then subtracted from your account.

### Advantages of ConnexCS Billing per minute

1. Channels come with peripheral considerations that make it more challenging to scale a billing unit. But per-minute rates are exact enough to scale with the system.

### Disadvantages of ConnexCS Billing per minute

1. Expensive with consistent traffic.
2. Multiple servers are more expensive.

## Minimum Charges

All accounts must spend a minimum cost per-server to remain active. Check [Pricing](https://connexcs.com/pricing) here. This helps to prevent incurring losses from stagnant accounts.
