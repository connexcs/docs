# Vouchers

**Management :material-menu-right: Vouchers**

**Vouchers** are like calling cards, with the optional benefit of applying for extra credits when a customer tops up their account.

**Vouchers** are available in both the Customer Portal and on WebPhone.

## Voucher Types

You can issue Vouchers in one of the following 3 forms:

* **Free Credit:** Once you enter the voucher code the credit applies independently of any other payment.
* **Multiplier Credit:** For example, Credit doubled for a top-up of $50 or more.
* **Additional Credit:** For example, $50 free credit for top-up of $100 or more.

## Voucher Setup

Click **`Add`**

* **Count:** Enter the number of vouchers you wish to create (you can use a voucher only once).

* **Minimum Activation:** Enter the minimum purchase amount required for the consumer to use the voucher.

    Set to '0' to give a customer entirely free credit.

* **Multiplier:** Enter the multiplier that applies to the customer's paid balance.

   For example, for a 10% bonus, set the Multiplier to 1.1.

* **Addition:** Enter the extra credit that applies to the customer's account.

For example, set 50 to give them $50, with or without a spend of their own, based on the Minimum Activation.

* **Currency Selector:** Select the desired currency.
