# Page Builder

## Introduction

Our **Page Builder** allows users to easily create and design forms/pages without needing or minimalist requirement to write code.

It provides a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality and various pre-built elements, making form creation accessible even to those with limited technical expertise.

### Key features and functionalities of the  Page builder:

1. **Drag-and-drop interface**: You can drag and drop various form elements like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-down menus, and more onto a visual canvas.
2. **Customization options**: You can customize the appearance of your form by changing colors, fonts, layouts, and adding your own branding elements.
3. **Conditional logic**: You can set up conditional logic, where certain form fields appear or disappear depending on the user's selections in other fields.
4. **Data validation**: Page builders offer built-in validation rules to ensure users enter data in the correct format (e.g., email address, phone number).
5. Integrations: You have the option yo integrate with various services like email marketing platforms, payment gateways, and CRM systems.
6. **Charts**: You can display your data using various types of charts.

## Component Attribute

A **component attribute** is a piece of data associated with a specific component within a Page.

It serves as a way to customize the component's behavior, appearance, or functionality.

Components in a Page Builder include Alert, Buttons, Sub-Form, Sub-Form+, Table etc.

We've explained the **Component Attribute** for each component individually in the **Components section**.

## Form Attribute

The Form attribute helps you specify values for the following parameters for all the fields in the form:

|**Name of the Component**|**Description**|**Icon**|
|-------------------------|---------------|---------|
|**UI**|User Interface refers to the graphical layout of an application. **Element and Ant Design** are for desktop components design and **Vuetify** focuses on designing for mobile components|<img src= "/apps/img/page_ui.png">|
|**Form Width**| Form width helps you decide the dimensions of the complete form|<img src= "/apps/img/page_formwidth.png">|
|**Label Position**|Label position helps you position the field labels.<br> You can decide between Left, Right and Top|<img src= "/apps/img/page_labelposition.png">|
|**Label Width**|Refers to the horizontal space allocated for displaying labels in a form or dialog box|<img src= "/apps/img/page_labelwidth.png">|

!!! Info 
    Form Attribute :material-menu-right: Datasource :material-menu-right: ScriptForge :material-menu-right: Websocket
    WebSocket enables you to create and manage WebSocket connections within your application. WebSockets are a powerful technology for establishing persistent, two-way communication channels between a web browser and a server, enabling real-time data exchange without the need for constant polling.
    **Example**:
    ```js
    const socket = this.scriptForge('myScriptForge')//creates a new WebSocket connection using the scriptForge function
    socket.send({hello: 'World'}) // sending a message
    socket.on('error', console.log) // handling errors
    socket.on('data', data => { // receiving data
        console.log('New Data In', data)
    })
    socket.close(); // closing the socket

    Form Attribute :material-menu-right: Datasource :material-menu-right: Stores
    Stores accesses Datasource form the Control Panel only.

    Form Attribute :material-menu-right: Datasource :material-menu-right: Databases
    Stores accesses Datasource form the Control Panel only.

!!! Info
    Form Attribute :material-menu-right: Datasource :material-menu-right: Saved Query
    Using the Page Builder interface we can run a complicated query (runs behind the scenes) and it returns the data. the Saved Queries can be accssed via ScriptForge.
    1. A query can be ran against different endpoints, (CDR, Primary Database, G3 Analytics), so we will need a selector.
    2. From the IDE perspective, we should be able to run an ad-hoc query, e.g we shouldn't need to create a new item and save it before we can run it.
    3. There should be a section for variables to be filled in, for example: 
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = :customer_id
    :customer_id is the replacement syntax
    4. Then when we run the query it will automatically replace :customer_id with the value associated with that variable.
    5. When the query is saved (/api/cp/setup/query) you can run it /api/cp/setup/query/1234/run with POST or GET and pass the variable along with it. Then it will inject the variables into the saved query and execute it.
    6. This query will then be accessible from ScriptForge or via the Page-builder.

!!! Info
    Form Attribute :material-menu-right: Datasource :material-menu-right: External
    Access information externally.

!!! Info
    ** window.ctx**: This function, when called, returns an object with the name **ctx**. This can be accessed using the browser's console.
    When any functions are being executed, "this" context is equivalent to "ctx." It'sÂ an incredibly efficient method for modifying code directly from the browser console.
