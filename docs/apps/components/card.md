# Card

## Description

A card in a form builder is a type of container that can be used to group related form fields together.

Cards are typically used to create a more organized and visually appealing form layout.

They can also help to improve the user experience by making it easier for users to scan the form and find the information they need.

5. Adding visual interest.

### Interactivity

**Interactivity** is the ability of a web page or application to respond to user input.

**Card** components can be interactive in a form builder.

They can be used to display information, collect user input, and trigger actions.

Some examples of how card components can be made interactive include:

1. **Adding Input fields to Cards**: You can add input fields, such as text fields, select boxes, and checkboxes, to cards to collect user input.

2. **Displaying Dynamic content**: You can use JavaScript to display dynamic content in cards, such as error messages or additional information based on user input.

3. **Triggering actions**: You can add buttons or links to cards to trigger actions, such as submitting a form or opening a pop-up window.

4. **Adding animations and effects**: You can use CSS to add animations and effects to cards, such as fading in or out elements or highlighting fields upon clicking.

5. **Responding to user interactions**: You can use JavaScript to handle user interactions with cards, such as clicks, selections, and changes. For example, you could use JavaScript to hide or show additional fields based on the user's selection in a dropdown menu.
