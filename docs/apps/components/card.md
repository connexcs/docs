2. **Displaying Dynamic content**: You can use JavaScript to display dynamic content in cards, such as error messages or additional information based on user input.

3. **Triggering actions**: You can add buttons or links to cards to trigger actions, such as submitting a form or opening a pop-up window.

4. **Adding animations and effects**: You can use CSS to add animations and effects to cards, such as fading in or out elements or highlighting fields upon clicking.

5. **Responding to user interactions**: You can use JavaScript to handle user interactions with cards, such as clicks, selections, and changes. For example, you could use JavaScript to hide or show additional fields based on the user's selection in a dropdown menu.
