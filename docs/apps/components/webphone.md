# Webphone

## Description

The Webphone is a SIP over WebRTC Softphone in the browser.

The Webphone component is available as an instant component with no programming required, or can be incrementally hidden and allows entire functionality delivered by the API.

It allows you to create a fully customised solution.

Here, you have the capability to set the [Environmental Variables](https://docs.connexcs.com/apps/architecture/environmental-variables/) which can be called as a **function** (internal or external) from the **Dynamic Data** option in the **Component Attribute** from the **Page Builder**.

!!! Example
    1. Configure the **Environmental Variables** as explained [here](https://docs.connexcs.com/apps/architecture/environmental-variables/#steps-for-configuring-the-variables).
    2. Navigate to [Page Builder](https://docs.connexcs.com/apps/page-builder/), select the component, click on [Component Attribute](https://docs.connexcs.com/apps/page-builder/#component-attribute), then **Option :material-menu-right: Dynamic Data :material-menu-right: Function**, click on Function (can be internal or external). You can call the environmental variables using `this.env`. You can create the function in [Form Attribute :material-menu-right: Action Panel](https://docs.connexcs.com/apps/page-builder/#form-attribute).
