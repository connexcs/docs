### Interactivity

Alerts lack a natural ability for interaction.

They're modal dialogue boxes that remain visible untilÂ the user decides to close them.

You would need to make a custom alert element and include event listeners in it in order to add interactivity to an alert.

**Examples may include:**

1. Clicking on a button to dismiss the alert.
2. Typing text into a text box to provide feedback.
3. Selecting an option from a list.
4. Submitting a form.
