# Key-Value

## Introduction

A **Key-Value Store**, also known as a key-value database, is a simple and efficient type of database that uses a "key-value" pair format to store data.

It's like a giant dictionary where each key acts as a unique identifier for a specific piece of information (the value).

## Key-value Pairs

Each data item is stored as a pair of a unique key and its associated value.
Think of it like a dictionary entry with a word (key) and its definition (value).
