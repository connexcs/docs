# Domain

## Introduction

You can set the **Domain** where your applications will be visible and publicly accessible.

For example, you can use the domain name as `test.cnx.page`. This domain is provided by us free of charge.

You can also use any custom domain.

## Steps for setting up the Domain

1. Login to your account.
2. Navigate to **IDE** :material-menu-right: `+` sign :material-menu-right: **Domain**.

<img src= "/apps/img/domain1.png" width= "350">

3.Select the App and enter the domain where the App will be visible and accessible.

4.Click `Save`.

<img src= "/apps/img/domain2.png">

### Custom Domain

If you want to setup your custom domain or your own domain for `app.mycustomdomain.com` for the Apps Platform, then you need to point your custom name as a `CNAME` record to `cnx.page`.

Custom Domain can be setup for any application you build using our Apps Platform.
