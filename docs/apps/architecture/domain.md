# Domain

## Introduction

You can set the **Domain** where your applications will be visible and publicly accessible.

For example, you can use the domain name as `test.cnx.page`. This domain is provided by us free of charge.

You can also use any custom domain.

## Steps for setting up the Domain

1. Login to your account.
2. Navigate to **IDE** :material-menu-right: Select an App/Create an App `+` sign :material-menu-right: **Domain**.

3.A window will pop-up as shown below.

Enter the domain name where your app will be displayed. You also have the option to use your own [Custom Domain](https://bani-customdomian--connexcs-docs.netlify.app/apps/architecture/domain/#custom-domain)

<img src= "/apps/img/domain2.png" width= "350">

3.Click `Save`.

!!! Warning
    For your application to be visible on the created domain, make sure you take care of the following things:
    1. The created domain should have the name "domain" as shown in the image below.
    2. The created user-interface in the **Page Builder** should have the **name** as **index**.

    <img src= "/apps/img/custom1.png">
    <img src= "/apps/img/custom2.png">

### Custom Domain

If you want to setup your custom domain or your own domain for `app.mycustomdomain.com` for the Apps Platform, then you need to point your custom name as a `CNAME` record to `cnx.page`.

Custom Domain can be setup for any application you build using our Apps Platform.
