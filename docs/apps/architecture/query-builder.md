# Introduction

A **Query builder** is a tool or library that helps developers construct database queries in a more intuitive and structured way, often without requiring direct knowledge of the query language (like SQL).

It serves as an abstraction layer between the developer and the database.

Common use cases include: Database Administration Tools, Web Application, Report Generation etc.
