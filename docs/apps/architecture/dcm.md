# Dynamic Content Module (DCM)

## Introduction

**DCM** is a templating or placeholder syntax used in ConnexCS Page Builder.
These are special placeholders (prefixed with `$`) that get replaced with real user or account data when a page is rendered.
They allow you to personalize content dynamically.

Each component in the Page Builder has their own modules. 

!!! Example "Example"
    ```js
    this.$('button1').setLabel('hello')
    ```
