# Introduction

Primary WebServer is stateless that includes the sessions. The Primary WebServer is Deployed Globally and serves via Anycast on Edge Nodes. If any server goes offline, it goes to the next available node.

Sessions are managed by encrypted cookies.

The Assets are served via a global CDN.

Allows you to lock the system to a particular version termed as Version Locking.

Also, allows for Continuous Integration which includes updation of latest features along with patches (worry free).

For example, there are 2 Call Centers "A" and "B". Call Center "A" doesn't want any automatic updates and on the other hand Call Center "B" expects their system updated each time any update is available. Thus, Call Center "A" can go for Version Locking and Call Center "B" can choose Continuous Integration.

Bank-end links to ScriptForge and from there you can access the following:

* Database
* KV Access
* Jobs
* ConnexCS Introspection API
* Pub-Sub
* Call Origination / Class 5 Features

Version Locking (Repeatable Delivery) OR Continuous Integration (Latest Features and Patches Worry Free)

It's a Server Side Chat Application.
