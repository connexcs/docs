# Introduction

The Application Platform is distributed over Pglobally, stateless webservers that includes the sessions.

It serves via Anycast on Edge Nodes. If any server goes offline, it goes to the next available node.

Sessions are managed by encrypted cookies.

All Assets are served via a global CDN.

We give you the option to lock the system to a particular version termed as Version Locking.

Another option we provide is Continuous Integration which includes updation of latest features along with patches (worry free).

For example, there are 2 Call Centers "A" and "B". Call Center "A" doesn't want any automatic updates and on the other hand Call Center "B" expects their system updated each time any update is available. Thus, Call Center "A" can go for Version Locking and Call Center "B" can choose Continuous Integration.

The Bank-end links to ScriptForge and from there you can access the following:

* Database
* KV Access
* Jobs
* ConnexCS Introspection API
* Pub-Sub
* Call Origination / Class 5 Features

Version Locking (Repeatable Delivery) OR Continuous Integration (Latest Features and Patches Worry Free)

It's a Server Side Chat Application.
