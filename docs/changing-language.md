!!! question "Will this change the language for every word in the UI?"
    Changing the language here will change most but not all the words in the Control Panel.

    To change existing translated words, and to add your own, go to **Setup :material-menu-right: Advanced :material-menu-right: [Language](https://docs.connexcs.com/setup/advanced/language/)**.

## Change the language in the Control Panel's User Interface

1. Click the down arrow next to your name (located at the top-right corner of the page).
2. Select `Change Language`.
3. Select a language from the drop-down list.
4. Click `Update`.
5. The ConnexCS Control Panel UI instantly displays most of the text in your preferred language.

The following image illustrates how your Control Panel looks if you change the language to Spanish.
