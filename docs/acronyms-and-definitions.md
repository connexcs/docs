# Acronyms and Definitions

ConnexCS uses standard telephony terminology in our Control Panel and documentation.

Find below the definitions for the most relevant telephony terms, along with some general networking terms and ConnexCS specific terms.

|Term|Definition|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|**ACD \ ALOC**|*Average Call Duration \ Average Length of Call*|The average length of calls. Average Call Duration or otherwise called Average Length of Call is a retrospective calculation of how long calls last, that is the mean average. Typically only connected calls are included in this calculation, so it is simply the total time that all of the calls were connected divided by the total number of connected calls.|

## ASR Inference

| S.No | ASR Score     | Inference          |
|------|---------------|--------------------|
| 1.   | 60% and above | Exceptionally good |
| 2.   | 40% to 50%    | Acceptable         |
| 3.   | Less than 40% | Poor               |

## ASR Calculations

1. **ASR Calculation** = Total Connected / Total Calls

2. **Strict ASR (Removing NER) Calculation** = Total Connected /Â Non-carrier failure

3. **NER Calculation** = Client Side Response Codes / Client + Server Codes

4. **Channels** = CPS * ACD

## CLI vs PAID

**PAID** is the address of the person who placed the call. This is same as the address in the "From" header, but it may change if the caller uses several identities and needs to represent the one that applies to the destination.

!!! Example
    Consider a call from alice@sip.com to the PSTN, where the P-Asserted-Identity field can be changed to the "alice" phone number.

**CLI** gives the calling phone's number to the party receiving the call. CLI is used to determine the caller or the place where a call originated.

The P-Asserted-Identity contains the caller id information for the call on the INVITE SIP packet. P-asserted-ID header may contain either Tel URI or SIP URI. For CLI identification purposes multiple P-Asserted-ID headers should not be used unless there is a P-asserted-ID containing Tel URI and/or a P-asserted-ID containing SIP URI and user=phone. In this case both type of URIs must contain the same phone number. If none of the above exist and contain a valid E.164 number, CLI will not be considered valid.

## Missed Call Traffic

Missed Call Traffic is placing calls which DONT connect and / or have a VERY SHORT duration.

It's not advisable not to have large volumes of Missed Call Traffic.
