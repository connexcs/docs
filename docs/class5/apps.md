**Class 5 :material-menu-right: Apps**

The ConnexCS **Apps** feature allows providers to create small, simple, drag-and-drop applications. Some examples are [**Pinless Calling Cards**](https://docs.connexcs.com/calling-card/), Echo Tests, Conferencing, or a Welcome message with an IVR setup and conditions.

## Build App

To create a new App:

1. Click the :material-plus: button.
2. Drag the desired functions from the left box's list into the right box.
3. Click on the function to edit the parameters.
4. Click **`Save`**.

!!! warning "Using Multiple Conditions"
    Apps can only use one Condition. Failure will occur if an app has several conditions.  

## Advanced Applications

To configure more complex applications, ConnexCS offers Class5 **[Programmable Voice](https://docs.connexcs.com/developers/scriptforge/#class-5-programmable-voice)** which allows you to build comprehensive applications using JavaScript.
