The **Phonebook** is an internal company directory that customers can set up for their users.

Since each customer has a customized phonebook per their request, other customers using the same account can't see their entries.

For individual customers, navigate to **Management :material-menu-right: Customer :material-menu-right: [Customer Name] :material-menu-right: Class5 :material-menu-right: Phonebook**

## Create Entry

1. Click :material-plus:.
2. Add the user's name and any other data that you wish to capture.
