## How to use Functions for the Large Language Models (LLMs)?

1. Develop an application utilizing the provided [link](https://docs.connexcs.com/apps/architecture/app/).
2. Create an **Agent** using the provided [link]().
3. Click on [Scriptforge](https://docs.connexcs.com/apps/architecture/script/) to create a script to access the AI Agent.

!!! Example "Example Script"
    ```js
    const llm = require('cxLLM'); // imports a module named `cxLLM` used for interacting with the LLM
    const moment = require('moment'); // imports the `moment` library used for  working with dates and times

    function main () {
        return llm.listFunctions(); //its an introspection capability; it parses the information and returns it as an object
    }

    /**
    * Retrieves the current day of the week // description of the function in `jsdoc` notation 
    *
    * @permissions Agent[123456] // indicates that these functions are restricted to agents with the specified permissions.
    * @returns {Promise<Object|string>} // functions return either a Promise (likely asynchronous) or a value (e.g., string or object); returns the current day of the week
    */
    function dayOfWeek() { // function retrieves the current day of the week using the moment library.
        return moment().format('dddd'); //  returns the full name of the day (e.g., "Monday").
    //    return {response: 'Monday'};
    }
    /**
    * Transfer the call // description of the function in `jsdoc` notation
    *
    * @permissions Agent[123456] // similar to the dayOfWeek function, it requires a specific permission (Agent[123456])
    * @param {Object} param - Param Object // function takes an object param with a property name, which is the name of the person to whom the call should be transferred
    * @param {string} param.name - The name of the person who you wish to transfer the call to.
    * @returns {Promise<Object|string>} - returns the current day of the week //  function returns a promise that resolves to either an object or a string
    */
    function transfer({name}) { // handles call transfer logic
        console.log(`We are going to transfer the call to ${name}`) //  name of the person to whom the call should be transferred
        return {action: 'transfer', data: {number: '160'}} // returns an object with `action: specifies the transfer action` and  `data:  Includes call transfer details like number (extension)`
    }
    ```

!!! Note "JSDoc Notation"
    Using JSDoc for optimizing function usage within LLMs:
     +  Provides clear descriptions of each function, parameter, and return type, making the purpose and behavior of LLM-related functions easy to understand.
     +  Reduces confusion and errors.
     +  With multiple developers working on an LLM project, JSDoc serves as a standardized way to share knowledge.
     +  LLM will exactly know how to interact with the code (Scriptforge).

    !!! Tip
        The function description must be brief, sharp, and accurate. Expanding it unnecessarily may create significant risks.
