# Knowledge Base

**Class 5 :material-menu-right: Knowledge Base**

## Overview

The **Knowledge Base** allows you to upload and index documents. The documents may include RFCs, technical manuals, or support guides so that AI agents and internal systems can reference them in real time.

It enhances automated support and search functionalities, enabling fast, accurate responses based on reliable source material.

Indexed documents go through a batch processing phase and are made searchable via structured metadata, making them valuable for internal teams, chatbots, or customer-facing tools.

### Use Cases

+ AI-Powered Support Bots
+ Internal Knowledge Retrieval
+ Compliance and Technical Reference

### Benefits

+ Centralized, searchable document repository
+ Supports AI chat integration
+ Automatic indexing of structured data
+ Works with public URLs and internal files
+ Tracks indexing status and history
