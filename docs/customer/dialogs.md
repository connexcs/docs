!!! note "Ended Status"
    "Ended" indicates a call is over, but the telephony switches are still tearing down the call, including the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) stream and any final signaling. After that, the server gathers data for billing.
!!! note "Global Dialogs"
    You can also see the status of all the calls for specific Customers in **Global :material-menu-right: Dialogs**.

    Also, you can select and end the calls using **End Calls** and the calls are terminaed using the MI Termination.
