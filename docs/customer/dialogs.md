# Dialogs

**Management :material-menu-right: Customer :material-menu-right: [Customer Name] :material-menu-right: Dialogs**

**Dialogs** display the status of current active calls on the account.

Use the **Refresh** button to get up-to-date information.

!!! note "Ended Status"
    "Ended" indicates a call is over, but the telephony switches are still tearing down the call, including the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) stream and any final signaling. After that, the server gathers data for billing.
!!! note "Global Dialogs"
    You can also configure Dialogs for specific Customers in **Global :material-menu-right: Dialogs**, which displays all configured Dialogs.
