The **Contracts** section lists contracts associated with the customer. **Contracts** are useful when you want new customers to agree to certain conditions before they can dial. Click on each name to view the details.

## Assign Contracts

1. Click :material-plus: and complete the following fields:

   + **Contract**: Select the desired Contract.
   + **Grace Date**: Let the customer demo the service until the selected date, after which they must agree to the contract to continue using the service.
   + **Required**: Enable this to shut down the account if the contract hasn't been yet signed after the Grace Date.

2. Click **`Save`** to assign the contact to the customer.
