## Internal Number Block

1. Click **:material-plus:** next to **Internal Number Block**.
2. The next available **Number Block** is assigned.
3. Numbers from the assigned range is then available in **Customer :material-menu-right: [Auth](/customer/auth/) for IP or SIP users**, and in **Class5 :material-menu-right: [Conference](/class5/creating-conference/)**.

!!! info "Why Define Internal Number Blocks?"
    Within each Account are multiple Customers, each will likely have more than one Contact.

    SIP Extensions are unique for the Account, not for individual Customers. 
    
    Without defined Internal Number Blocks, there is the risk of a Contact attempting to use an extension that's already in use by another Customer or Contact. 
    
    With Internal Number Blocks defined, each Customer will have a predetermined list of Usernames to select for SIP Authentication.

!!! note "Number Range parameters"
    The Number Range Start and Block Size must be defined under [**Settings :material-menu-right: Options**](https://docs.connexcs.com/setup/settings/options/) before an Internal Number Block can be assigned.

You can perform the following functions with this data:

* **Sum and Average**: Select multiple cells in a column to get sum and average values (not a true average, but an average of averages).

* **Export Data**: Select data from multiple columns and rows, then right-click to `Copy`, `Copy with Headers`, or `Export`.

* **Generate Invoice**: Select one or more checkboxes under Action, and then select **`Generate Invoice`** in the upper right corner. This will create the invoice based on the Summary time frame (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) which can then be queried by a billing system.

* **Auto Generate Invoice**: Select this to generate an invoice based on the settings found in the Customer configuration (**Edit :material-menu-right: Config :material-menu-right: Invoice Schedule**) for any that are missing.
