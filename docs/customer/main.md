## Internal Number Block

Assign an **Internal Number Block** to define the range of numbers a Customer can use for setting up SIP Extensions (see [**SIP Authentication**](https://docs.connexcs.com/customer/auth/#sip-user-authentication) for configuration details).

The Internal Number Block ensures number allocations are managed efficiently.

### Key Features/Benefits

1. **Namespace and Extension Management**:

      1. Each customer operates within a unique namespace.
      2. Duplicate extensions across multiple customers are prevented.

2. **Number Allocation**:

      1. **Without a Number Block**: Any extension can be added without restrictions.
      2. **With a Number Block**: Extensions must be chosen from a predefined range.
      3. Administrators can assign number blocks to specific users.

### Steps to implement Internal Number Block

1. Click **:material-plus:** next to **Internal Number Block**
2. The next available **Number Block** is assigned.
3. Numbers from the assigned range is then available in **Customer :material-menu-right: [Auth](/customer/auth/) for IP or SIP users**, and in **Class5 :material-menu-right: [Conference](/class5/creating-conference/)**.

!!! info "Why Define Internal Number Blocks?"
    1. Within each Account are multiple Customers, each will likely have more than one Contact.

    2. SIP Extensions are unique for the Account, not for individual Customers. 
    
    3. Without defined Internal Number Blocks, there is the risk of a Contact attempting to use an extension that's already in use by another Customer or Contact. 
    
    4. With Internal Number Blocks defined, each Customer will have a predetermined list of Usernames to select for SIP Authentication.

!!! note "Number Range parameters"
    The Number Range Start and Block Size must be defined under [**Settings :material-menu-right: Options**](https://docs.connexcs.com/setup/settings/options/) before an Internal Number Block can be assigned.
