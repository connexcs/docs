**Class5** features include the ConnexCS Unified Communications Service (UCS) package. While Class4 routing is the major focus of the ConnexCS system.

The customers can configure several functionalities in this area to enhance the user experience.

Class 5 functionalities include various telephony and call-handling capabilities.

+ [**Directory**](https://docs.connexcs.com/class5/phonebook/): A list of all endpoints which a customer can dial.

+ [**Apps**](/class5/apps/): Allow customers to configure various features such as Pinless Calling or DNC (Do Not Call) lists. It includes the full functionality of Script Forge.
You can configure this in Class5 :material-menu-right: Apps.

+ [**Conference**](/class5/creating-conference/): Allow several callers to join one conference call or bridge.

+ [**Call Center**](https://docs.connexcs.com/class5/call-center/): The Call-Center feature uses a score-based approach to distribute calls, increasing a caller's score by 1 for every second they wait.

+ [**IVR**](/class5/creating-ivr/): Automated response system. Presents callers with a menu and options for call routing.

+ [**Groups**](/class5/creating-group/): Allow you to distribute inbound calls to a predefined team. Calls can be directed to multiple recipients:
      + **Parallel Ringing**: All recipients are rung simultaneously.
      + **Sequential Ringing**: Calls are tried one-by-one until answered.
      + **Call Center Queues**: Calls are systematically distributed.
