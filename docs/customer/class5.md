+ [**Conference**](/class5/creating-conference/) allows multiple callers to join one conference call, or bridge.


+ [**IVR**](/class5/creating-ivr/) presents callers with a menu and options for call routing.


+ [**Groups**](/class5/creating-group/) allows you to distribute inbound calls to a predefined team.


+ [**Voicemail**](/class5/voicemail/) is managed under specific customers or in a bulk view under Class5 :material-menu-right: Voicemail. 


+ [**Phonebook**](/class5/phonebook/) allows all users to receive the same list of numbers within the customer, essentially a company directory.
