## Platform Intelligence

Before setting up your customers, let's take a moment to understand the powerful intelligence built into the ConnexCS platform.

ConnexCS stands out as an intelligent platform in the telecommunications domain through the integration of several sophisticated features.

At the core lies **[ASR+](https://docs.connexcs.com/customer/routing/#answer-seizure-ratio-plus-details)**, a technology that continuously analyzes call data to identify and filter out known bad numbers.
By learning from real-time call outcomes, ASR+ proactively prevents calls to unreachable destinations, minimizing wasted resources and significantly improving call success rates.

[ConnexCS AnyEdge](https://docs.connexcs.com/anyedge/anyedge/) acts as a **high-performance load balancer and traffic dispatcher**. This intelligent component distributes traffic seamlessly across multiple SIP servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and minimizing latency.
AnyEdge also offers customizable call distribution rules, allowing businesses to prioritize critical calls and optimize routing for specific customer segments.

ConnexCS incorporates **[Spam Scout Scoring](https://docs.connexcs.com/guides/spam-callsblock/#64-using-spam-scout-scoring)**. By providing options to block calls based on spam score. Spam Scout effectively reduces the impact of spam calls on network resources and enhances the user experience.

Complementing Spam Scout is **[IPQS](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/)**. It also blocks the calls based on the spam score. The spam score is provided by a third party IPQS.

By proactively managing traffic, enhancing call quality, and improving network security, ConnexCS empowers businesses to optimize their telecommunications operations, reduce costs, and deliver a superior customer experience.

The combination of intelligent capabilities positions ConnexCS as a leading-edge solution in the telecommunications industry, providing businesses with a competitive advantage in today's dynamic market.
