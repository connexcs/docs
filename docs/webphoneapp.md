# WebPhone App

# Introduction

The ConnexCS WebPhone Application is fully customizable. It replaces the old legacy Web Phone Application.

Our new [Apps Platform](https://docs.connexcs.com/apps/introduction/) lets you build your ideal and robust WebPhone. You can configure that resonates with your preferences.

Customers can make calls over the internet with the ConnexCS WebPhone App (softphone). It operates straight from a browser, without the need to install any software.

This cross-platform application is ideal for call centers and similar deployments. It works with Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and other operating systems.
