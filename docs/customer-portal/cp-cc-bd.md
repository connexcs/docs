    3. `Data Recycle`: Recycles leads that didnâ€™t connect (e.g., no answer, busy) by returning them to the dial queue and updating their status based on retry rules.

18. **Call Status**: Displays counts for different call outcomes; like `Call Answered`, `Failed Calls`, `Call In Progress`, `Call Ringing`, `Dropped Calls`.

19. **Disposition Status**: Shows a pie chart for all the call disposition outcomes. Each colored section of the pie chart corresponds to one of these dispositions.

20. **Lead Agents Activity**: It displays performance stats of individual agents. The metrics include `Call Transfered`, `Busy`, `Call Back`, `Do Not Call`, `Not interested`, `Null`, `Sale made`, `Wrong details` etc.

With your Campaign, Agents, Agent Script, and Leadset configured, the next step is to access the **Agent Dialer** to start placing calls.

!!! Tip "Disposition in Broadcast Dialer"
      As in the Broadcast Dialer the AI Agent can't set the `Disposition Status`. You need to do the following in order to add the capability for adding the disposition status.
      While creating your AI Agent you need to the following things:
      1. In the `Advanced` tab select `Set Variable` in the `Built-in Function` field.
      2. In the `Model` tab in the `Prompt` field you need to give a prompt which says that the status should be saved in the variable; using the **functions**: `name`=`status` and `value`=`[status]`

!!! Example "Example Prompt"
      Your first task is to ask the status: "What's your status?", as you don't currently know the status.
      Once the status has been provided, store it in the variable name. Don't store the variable unless you have been given it by the customer. don't save anything until the customer gives you 
      Don't proceed with anything else until you have successfully collected and stored the status by calling the setVariable function with `name`=`status` and `value`=`[status]`.
