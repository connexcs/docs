## Overview

The DID Purchase application allows customers to browse and acquire DIDs (phone numbers) that are made available by their carrier through the ConnexCS platform.

ConnexCS does not sell or resell DIDs directly — instead, it provides the infrastructure for carriers to list, manage, and distribute their own DID inventories to their customers.

Each DID may have a different subscription plan, which can include flexible billing options such as monthly, weekly, or daily cycles, depending on how the carrier has configured its offerings.

### DID Pricing in the Customer Portal

Each DID displayed in the Customer Portal includes a price that is defined by the carrier’s pricing package.

This price is visible to customers during the DID purchase process.

### DID Visibility in the Customer Portal

This feature demonstrates the capability of the ConnexCS platform to integrate with carrier inventories, where:

+ **Range Holder Carriers**: These are carriers that own DID ranges allocated by regulatory authorities or government bodies. They can upload and manage these DIDs within their ConnexCS account to make them available to their customers.
