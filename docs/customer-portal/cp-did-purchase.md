# DID Purchase

## Overview

The DID Purchase application allows customers to browse and acquire DIDs (phone numbers) that are made available by their carrier through the ConnexCS platform.

ConnexCS does not sell or resell DIDs directly — instead, it provides the infrastructure for carriers to list, manage, and distribute their own DID inventories to their customers.

Each DID may have a different subscription plan, which can include flexible billing options such as monthly, weekly, or daily cycles, depending on how the carrier has configured its offerings.

This price is visible to customers during the DID purchase process.
