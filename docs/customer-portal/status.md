# Status

A status page is a dedicated page  that provides real-time information about the status of a service, application, or system.

It's a crucial tool for both service providers and users to stay informed about any disruptions, outages, or maintenance activities.

2. **Report History**: Users can view a history of past incidents, including details about the nature of the issue, when was it created, and the status like *Fixed*, *Investigating*, *Identified*, *Watching*.
