## View and Approve Contracts

You can view and approve assigned **Contracts** in two places:

1. Click on the Contract `Name`.
2. Click `Approve` under Approved By.

Both actions will bring up the Contract screen. It will display the text of the Contract for review.

To approve, enter the text name of the approver and toggle to "I Agree," and then click **`I Approve`**.  

If a contract gets approved, only the text is available on this screen.
