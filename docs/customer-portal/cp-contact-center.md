# Contact Center

## Overview

The ConnexCS Dialer is a comprehensive contact center solution designed to streamline outbound and inbound campaigns.

It includes a Dialer Dashboard, Agent Management, Campaign Management, and Lead Management functionalities.

The dialer supports both Auto Dialer and Preview Dialer modes for flexibility in call operations.

## Types of Dialer

At ConnexCS we've three types of dialers at your disposal.

### **Auto Dialers**

 Its an outbound dialing system that automatically dials numbers from a contact list and connects answered calls to available agents in real-time.

This auto dialer dials one number per available agent only after they finish their current call. It‚Äôs safer but a bit slower.

**Pros**:

+ **Accuracy**: Reduction in dropped calls as calls are made only when agent is available.
+ **Better agent control**: Agents aren't overwhelmed with back-to-back calls.
+ **Improved call quality**: Agents get better to prepare between calls.
+ **Easier integration and implementation**

**Cons**:

+ Lower call volume throughput.
+ More dropped calls as the system may over-dial.
+ Shorter lead time for agents.
+ Back-to-back calls can make agents frustrated.

        F --> B
        E --> A
    ```

**Key Features**:

+ 1:1 dialing ratio is one call per agent.
+ No calls are made unless the agents are available/ready.
+ Skips busy, no-answer, or failed numbers automatically. **DO WE HAVE THIS FEATURE?**
+ Minimizes downtime between calls without overwhelming agents. **DOES THIS HAPPEN WITH OUR DIALER?**

### Preview Dialer

A Preview Dialer is an outbound dialing system, where the agent has detailed information about the customer before dialing.

The agent gets enough time to review and decide whether to call the person and hit the call button to initiate the call

        E --> F(["üîÑ Next preview pops up"])
        F --> B
    ```
Best for: Complex or high-value calls where agents need context (e.g., sales or support follow-ups).

**Pros**:

+ Personalization, higher quality interactions.
+ Agents feel more in control, less rushed.
+ Agents align calls to customer needs.

**Cons**:

+ Slower pace.
+ Fewer calls per hour as compared to Auto Dialer.
+ Skips Lead Automation.
+ More agent involvement leads to inconsistent flow.

### Broadcast Dialer (AI Agent)

A Broadcast Dialer is an automated outbound calling system where an AI Agent initiates and handles the entire interaction with the customer. This dialer involves no human intervention.

Once activated, the system starts dialing contacts in bulk. The AI Agent engages with each person using natural conversation, guided by a predefined script and logic.

You can create your own personal AI Agent with ConnexCS. [Click here](https://docs.connexcs.com/class5/ai-agent/) to know more.

        E --> B

**Pros**:

+ High speed and efficiency ‚Äî thousands of calls per hour.
+ Consistent, 24/7 availability.
+ Reduced cost due to no human involvement.

**Cons**:

+ Limited to structured or semi-structured conversations.
+ May not handle highly emotional or unpredictable interactions as well as a human.
+ Requires upfront setup and testing for smooth operation.

With your Campaign, Agents, Agent Script, and Leadset configured, the next step is to access the **Agent Dialer** to start placing calls.

!!! Tip "Disposition in Broadcast Dialer"
      As in the Broadcast Dialer the AI Agent cannot set the `Disposition Status`. You need to do the following in order to add the capability for ading the disposition status.
      While creating your AI Agent you need to the following things:
      1. In the `Advanced` tab select `Set Variable` in the `Built-in Function` field.
      2. In the `Model` tab in the `Prompt` field you need to give a prompt which says that the status should be saved in the variable; using the **functions**: `name`=`status` and `value`=`[status]`

         !!! Example "Example Prompt"
               Your first task is to ask the staus: "What is your status?", as you don't currently know the status.
               Once the status has been provided, store it in the variable name. Do not store the variable unless you have been given it by the customer. don't save anything until the customer gives you 
               Do not proceed with anything else until you have successfully collected and stored the status by calling the setVariable function with `name`=`status` and `value`=`[status]`.

### Step-III: Setup Dialers

#### Preview Dialer

1. Enter the domain as entered in the **IDE** in [Step-I](add link). The screen will prompt the agent to enter the `Username` and `Password`. Click on `Login`. <img src="/customer-portal/img/cc37.png">
2. Select the campaign `Preview Dialler` from the drop-down menu and click `Confirm`. <img src="/customer-portal/img/cc38.png">
3. An Agent Dialer interface with the following fields will appear:
   1. `Selected Campgain` from the drop-down menu.
   2. `Keypad` for dialing the numbers.
   3. `Script`: Displays the call script the agent should follow.
   4. `Logout` for the agent to log off from the system. <img src="/customer-portal/img/cc39.png">
   5. `Contact information` of the customer sourced from the **uploaded Leadset** or entered manually via the **Lead Form**.
   6. `Lead Preview`: Opens lead details for the agent.
   7. `Invalid Details`: Lets the agent flag the lead if information is incorrect or incomplete.
