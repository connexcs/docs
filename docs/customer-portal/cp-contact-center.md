# Contact Center

## Overview

The ConnexCS Dialer is a comprehensive contact center solution designed to streamline outbound and inbound campaigns.

It includes a Dialer Dashboard, Agent Management, Campaign Management, and Lead Management functionalities.

The dialer supports both Auto Dialer and Preview Dialer modes for flexibility in call operations.

## Types of Dialer

At ConnexCS we've three types of dialers at your disposal.

### **Auto Dialers**

 Its an outbound dialing system that automatically dials numbers from a contact list and connects answered calls to available agents in real-time.

This auto dialer dials one number per available agent only after they finish their current call. It‚Äôs safer but a bit slower.

**Pros**:

+ **Accuracy**: Reduction in dropped calls as calls are made only when agent is available.
+ **Better agent control**: Agents aren't overwhelmed with back-to-back calls.
+ **Improved call quality**: Agents get better to prepare between calls.
+ **Easier integration and implementation**

**Cons**:

+ Lower call volume throughput.
+ More dropped calls as the system may over-dial.
+ Shorter lead time for agents.
+ Back-to-back calls can make agents frustrated.

        F --> B
        E --> A
    ```

**Key Features**:

+ 1:1 dialing ratio is one call per agent.
+ No calls are made unless the agents are available/ready.
+ Skips busy, no-answer, or failed numbers automatically. **DO WE HAVE THIS FEATURE?**
+ Minimizes downtime between calls without overwhelming agents. **DOES THIS HAPPEN WITH OUR DIALER?**

### Preview Dialer

A Preview Dialer is an outbound dialing system, where the agent has detailed information about the customer before dialing.

The agent gets enough time to review and decide whether to call the person and hit the call button to initiate the call

        E --> F(["üîÑ Next preview pops up"])
        F --> B
    ```
Best for: Complex or high-value calls where agents need context (e.g., sales or support follow-ups).

**Pros**:

+ Personalization, higher quality interactions.
+ Agents feel more in control, less rushed.
+ Agents align calls to customer needs.

**Cons**:
+ Slower pace.
+ Fewer calls per hour as compared to Auto Dialer.
+ Skips Lead Automation.
+ More agent involvement leads to inconsistent flow.

Campaign:

2 types:

Preview dialer
Auto dialer: beneficial for outbound calls; automatically loads up the contact details; call transfer option to manager; submit and go on pause option; if the call gets disconnected and the agent is taking more than 30 seconds to select/set the disposition, the agent will ne removed from the queue.
