# Contact Center

## Overview

The ConnexCS Dialer is a comprehensive contact center solution designed to streamline outbound and inbound campaigns.

It includes a Dialer Dashboard, Agent Management, Campaign Management, and Lead Management functionalities.

The dialer supports both Auto Dialer and Preview Dialer modes for flexibility in call operations.

## Types of Dialer

At ConnexCS we've three types of dialers at your disposal.

1. **Auto Dialers**

 Its an outbound dialing system that automatically dials numbers from a contact list and connects answered calls to available agents in real-time.

This auto dialer dials one number per available agent only after they finish their current call. It‚Äôs safer but a bit slower.

**Pros**: Reduces dropped calls.

**Cons**: Lower call volume throughput.

**Key Features**:

+ 1:1 dialing ratio is one call per agent.
+ No calls are made unless the agents are available/ready.
+ Skips busy, no-answer, or failed numbers automatically. **DO WE HAVE THIS FEATURE?**
+ Minimizes downtime between calls without overwhelming agents. **DOES THIS HAPPEN WITH OUR DIALER?**

**Advantages**:

+ **Accuracy**: Reduction in dropped calls as calls are made only when agent is available.
+ Better agent control

We start from creating an **Agent**

2 types:

Preview dialer
Auto dialer: beneficial for outbound calls; automatically loads up the contact details; call transfer option to manager; submit and go on pause option; if the call gets disconnected and the agent is taking more than 30 seconds to select/set the disposition, the agent will ne removed from the queue.

Script: the agent will follow the script
