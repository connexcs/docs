**Dialogs** display the status of presently active calls on the account. Use the **Refresh** button to get up-to-date information.

!!! note "Ended Status"
    "Ended" indicates a call is over, but the telephony switches are still tearing down the call, including the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) stream and any final signaling. After that, the server gathers data for billing.
