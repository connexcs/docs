# Recording

The **Recording** area allows you to listen to recorded calls, provided this feature is available on your account.

1. Under **Path**, select the date (YYYY-MM-DD format) to inspect.

2. This will list all recordings for that date.
3. You can identify specific calls in two ways:
    + **Path:** Use the Call-ID which you can find in [**Latest Calls**](cp-latest-calls.md)).
    + **Last Modified:** If there are some calls, you can find them by searching for the time the call ended. This is less conclusive than using Call-ID, in particular when there are a lot of calls.
4. Select **Download** or **Play Audio** to access the recording.
5. Select **`Back`** to go back to the list of dates.
