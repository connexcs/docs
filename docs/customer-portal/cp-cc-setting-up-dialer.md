   Add and configure **Agents** who will handle calls associated with the campaign. Assign appropriate access and credentials.

3. **[Script Creation](https://e42c09b3.docs-eri.pages.dev/customer-portal/cp-cc-creating-scripts/)**:
   Prepare a **Script** for agents to follow during calls—this ensures consistent communication and better engagement.
