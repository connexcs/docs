|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
|**Live Channels** |Details of active channel usage|
|**ASR** |You can view Answer Seizure Ratio as a Total, or isolate traffic on a per-carrier basis (click on a customer to remove or add it from the graph); if some carriers are lower than others, this may create an issue|
|**ACD**|You can view the total average call duration or isolate traffic by carrier (click on a customer to remove or add it to the graph). A lower ACD on one carrier is indicative of potential line quality issues|

## Summary

The Summaries of calls in Live (last 24 hours), Daily, and Monthly formats are all displayed in 24-hour UTC. This data updates hourly.

You can perform the following Functions with this data:

+ **Sum and Average:** Select several cells in a column to get the sum and average values (not a true average, but an average of averages).
+ **Export Data:** Select data from several columns and rows, then right-click to `Copy`, `Copy with Headers`, or `Export`.
+ **Generate Invoice:** Select one or more checkboxes under Action and then select **`Generate Invoice`** in the upper right corner. This will create the invoice based on the Summary time-frame (Daily, Weekly, Monthly). A billing system can then query the invoice.

!!! tip "Data used for billing"
