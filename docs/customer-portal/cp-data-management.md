# Database

The **Database** allows you to create custom persistent data storage. A datastore can be specific to a single customer or global (used with any customer).

You can use **Database** for activities like checking list of numbers, caching external lookups, or creating stateful applications that provide users a set number of free minutes per month.

You can view the databases (only which are assigned to a particular customer) here created on the **Control Panel**.

Also, clicking on the `blue +` sign you can add new **Key-Value** pair.
