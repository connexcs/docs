# Campaign Creation

## Overview

Campaign is designed to efficiently manage and monitor calling activities, agent performance, and lead engagement.

It involves configuring various elements to optimize outreach, customer service, or sales efforts.

## Steps to create Campaign

2. A `Campaign Overview` will open. This interface is used for real-time monitoring of campaigns, lead stats, agent statuses, and calling activity. <br><img src= "/customer-portal/img/88cc.png" style="border: 2px solid #4472C4; border-radius: 8px;"></br> <br><img src="/customer-portal/img/89ccnew.png" width= "800" style="border: 2px solid #4472C4; border-radius: 8px;"></br><br><img src= "/customer-portal/img/pdcampaign1.png" style="border: 2px solid #4472C4; border-radius: 8px;"></br>

3. `State`: Whether the campaign is `Active` or `Inactive`.

4. `Edit Campaign`: Open the campaign settings for editing.
