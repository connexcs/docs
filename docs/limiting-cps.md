# Capacity Limiting

## Limiting Calls per Second and Channels

The ability to Limit CPS (Flow Speed) and Channels allows providers to place caps on specific services.

* Channels represent the number of active calls on the system.
* CPS (Calls per Second) tracks the number of calls made in a given second.

ConnexCS offers a range of options to limit CPS and Channels across the entire account, per carrier, or per customer.

!!! info "Server capacity error"
    When a server reaches capacity, the standard response is: *Request Terminated: Server at max cps / channels*.

    If you have several servers, you can send a 302 response if the server reaches capacity, advising the client of an alternative location to complete the call.

!!! warning "CPS on load-balanced servers"
    If you have several servers in load balancing configuration, it's recommended that you enable "Cluster."

    For example, if you set CPS to 10, clustered servers will allow 10 CPS total and un-clustered servers will allow 10 CPS per server. See [**Servers**](https://docs.connexcs.com/setup/settings/servers/) for more details.
